# Work Samples

## Python
### PowerBall Simulation
#### Overview
Using python, the goal was to determine the distribution for how much money a random person would make playing the lottery for 30 years. Assumptions include the individual bought one ticket every week for $2 and the winning values are between 1 and 69. This example was used as an assignment for STA 6326 Theoretical Statistics 1 at the University of Central FLorida.
### Flipping a Coin
#### Overview
The goal was to simulate and model the relative frequency of tossing a coin a signifigant number of times. This example was used as an assignment for STA 6326 Theoretical Statistics 1 at the University of Central Florida.
## Logistic Regression


## Projects
### Predicting Laptop Prices
#### Overview
This project sought to find a predictive model that would estimate the current price of a laptop (in Indian Rupees) as accurately as possible. Accuracy was determined based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) where a lower value indicated a better performing model. The project was used as term project for STA 6714 Data Preparation at the University of Central Florida.
