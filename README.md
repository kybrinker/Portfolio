# Work Samples

## Python
### Large Language Model
#### Objective
Given the reviews for Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneland California, we want to use the reviews of various guests to predict the location. The data set does contain reviews from Disneyland Paris, but we will focus on the two locations listed by restricting the data to the first 25000 reviews within the dataset. This was chosen as the file already had the known locations in order: Disneyland Hong Kong, Disneyland California, and Disneyland Paris respectively. Thus by restricting the data to the first 25000 observations, we will eliminate the Disnleyland Paris entries and reduce the dataset for slighlty faster perfomance of the LLM model.

### Preparing Data for Regression
#### Overview
This code focuses on preparing data for regression supervised learning for the price of diamonds. Feature selection and analysis will occur at a later stage.

## Projects
### Predicting Laptop Prices
#### Overview
This project sought to find a predictive model that would estimate the current price of a laptop (in Indian Rupees) as accurately as possible. Accuracy was determined based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) where a lower value indicated a better performing model. The project was used as term project for STA 6714 Data Preparation at the University of Central Florida.

### Video Game Suggestions
In collaboration with Janie Ha, a fellow student in the data analytics bootcamp hosted by Brainstation, this project analyzed various video game genres to make reccomendations based on sales, critic scores, and user count. Data was refined and filtered using SQL and visualized through Tableau.
