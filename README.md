# Work Samples

## Python
### PowerBall Simulation
#### Overview
Using python, the goal was to determine the distribution for how much money a random person would make playing the lottery for 30 years. Assumptions include the individual bought one ticket every week for $2 and the winning values are between 1 and 69. This example was used as an assignment for STA 6326 Theoretical Statistics 1 at the University of Central FLorida.

### Flipping a Coin
#### Overview
The goal was to simulate and model the relative frequency of tossing a coin a signifigant number of times. This example was used as an assignment for STA 6326 Theoretical Statistics 1 at the University of Central Florida.

## Projects
### Predicting Laptop Prices
#### Overview
This project sought to find a predictive model that would estimate the current price of a laptop (in Indian Rupees) as accurately as possible. Accuracy was determined based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) where a lower value indicated a better performing model. The project was used as term project for STA 6714 Data Preparation at the University of Central Florida.

### Video Game Suggestions
In collaboration with Janie Ha, a fellow student in the data analytics bootcamp hosted by Brainstation, this project analyzed various video game genres to make reccomendations based on sales, critic scores, and user count. Data was refined and filtered using SQL and visualized through Tableau.
